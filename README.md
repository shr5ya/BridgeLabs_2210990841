The Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are two essential components for working with Java. The JRE is responsible for running Java applications; it contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the core libraries needed to execute Java bytecode. However, it doesn’t include development tools like a compiler. That’s where the JDK comes in—it includes the JRE along with tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities necessary for writing and building Java programs. When you write code in Java, the compiler (javac) translates the .java source files into .class files containing bytecode. This bytecode is platform-independent and is executed by the JVM, which acts as an interpreter, reading and executing each line of bytecode during runtime. So, the compiler handles translation during development, while the interpreter ensures the program runs as expected on any machine with a JVM. This dual-stage process is a key reason Java is considered both compiled and interpreted.

We also created new branch on the github repo with command, git branch Features and then we pushed our branch, git push -u origin Features and then we checked what all branches we have with command,git branch. we added anew file called text1 in features branch. we also made another branch called features1.

Local variable: declared within the method.
Instance:declare outside method but within class.
Static: declare with static keyword.
and also about their declaration, initialization.
Then we discussed about classes and its declaration.

we did revision of everything and than we did calculator with the help of scanner input taking everything as input, than we did double and float and long in it. than we did our first program in notepad++,comppiled the file than exectued it taking scanner input code.

3/07/2025
we did a quick revision of java syntax than we did a few codes on notepad++ like printing hello world.
